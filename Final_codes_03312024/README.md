# CIND820---Big-Data-Analytics-Project-Course-Workflow

This project aims to compare the performance of various regression models on a given dataset. The goal is to find the model that provides the best predictive accuracy for the target variable.

## Overview

In this project, we explore several regression models including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, and Support Vector Regression (SVR). We train each model on a training dataset, validate their performance using cross-validation, and evaluate them on a separate test dataset. We also perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the performance of each model.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains [description of the dataset].

## Project Structure

- `datasets/`: Contains the dataset files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks containing data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required to run the project.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bidhansarker-ai/Big_Data_Certification_Final_Submission.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
    cd CIND820---Big-Data-Analytics-Project-Course-Workflow
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage

1. Explore the dataset in the `data/` directory.

2. Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to view the data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning processes.

3. Run the notebooks to execute the code and reproduce the results.

## Results

The evaluation results of each model, including RMSE, MAE, and accuracy percentage, are summarized in the notebooks and can be visualized to compare the performance of different models.

## Conclusion

Based on the evaluation results, we can conclude which regression model performs best for this dataset and use it for future predictions.
